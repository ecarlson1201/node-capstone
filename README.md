Time Flies is a scheduling app that determines the amount of unproductive time the user has during their day.
A user can login and add their weekly schedule to the app. The app will then calculate how much time each day is being underutilized.
The user can also modify their schedule by adding new entries or updating/deleting existing entries.

The following user is available for testing:
